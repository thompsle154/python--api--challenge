The Weather Py project analyzed the weather across 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. The plots showed various relationships and the biggest change in the weather depending on the cities latitude was max temperature. The linear regression plots between northern and southern hemisphere did not display much of a correlation between the data sets.

The Vacation Py project analyzed the weather data to plan future vacations. The dataframes showed the best places to go on vacation based on the weather, and also included a hotel name. The first heatmap displayed is the humidity for every city in the Weather Py project. The second heatmap is to show the best hotel for each city, however the hotel, city, and country are not displayed.
